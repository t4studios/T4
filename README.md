# Galaxy Clicker

## Backstory

Galaxy Clicker is a cosmic-themed clicker game where you embark on a journey to expand your galaxy one click at a time. The game's concept was born from a late-night burst of inspiration, leading to a development cycle focused on creating an engaging and visually pleasing experience.

## Development

The initial development for Galaxy Clicker began on **August 12, 2025, at 10:00 PM Eastern Time** at my home. The goal was to build a simple yet captivating game with responsive UI, dynamic animations, and a rich achievement system. The core mechanics of clicking, earning trophies, and tracking progress were implemented first, followed by a detailed design pass to create the "cosmic" feel of the game.

## Release

The game is currently in active development, but the expected release is by the end of the week. We are targeting a public launch on **August 16, 2025, at 12:00 PM Eastern Time**, with the hope of providing players with a fun and polished experience. Get ready to start clicking and building your own galactic empire!
